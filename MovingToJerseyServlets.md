# Checkout the repo here: https://github.com/JudeaDumont/jersey-servlet-scaffolding
- I have setup the jersey servlet in there with apache tomcat
- I have also setup github actions that is now building the jersey servlet using jdk20

- Next I will need to install a VM for ubuntu so I have another avenue of developing github actions with my software.

- next I will need to setup github actions for the "jersey servlet" repo, with apache tomcat as an apt-get install

- Then I will need to deploy the simple-service project, 

- Then I will need to figure out how to tell tomcat to host on a different port, 
- I am pretty sure this has to do with connectors
- 

- then I will need to find a way to run the unit tests for it, both locally and in github actions

- then I will need to introduce other components of the system, either on the same container

- but maybe splitting them up into multiple containers for github actions to test is a good future

- if github actions supports multiple container testing scenarios, I will need to use that
